Python code to allow analysis of Ca2+ linescan data with a gui interface

PyQt5 interface for linescan homogeneity and transient kinetics/amplitude analysis. 
You can load .tif of .czi images. Czi files will update the lines per second and pixel size. 
If using .tif these will need to be changed manually.
